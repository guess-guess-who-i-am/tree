## Task Graph (llm-task-tree)

This project uses **`task-tree.md`** at the repository root as shared task state for agents.

**Prefer the `task_tree_*` MCP tools when they are available**

Registered for Codex via `[mcp_servers.task_tree]` in `~/.codex/config.toml`, and for Cursor via the committed `.cursor/mcp.json` (which points at `llm-task-tree/mcp-server.mjs`). When the tools are present, use them instead of hand-editing markdown:

- Read focus with `task_tree_focus`; read one node with `task_tree_node`.
- Write with `task_tree_write` (field-level). It backs up, enforces the compact gate, syncs flow status, and refuses `GraphState.Current/Next/NextPlan` — so focus stays the user's call.
- `task_tree_chain` advances one chain step; `task_tree_flow_status` reports flow drift; `task_tree_check_compact` runs the gate; `task_tree_layout` re-arranges the canvas; `task_tree_knowledge` searches the local index.
- When the user wants to *work with* the graph, `task_tree_open` embeds the real UI in the chat (MCP Apps widget): dragging, editing, flow view, knowledge panel. When they only want a look, `task_tree_render` returns a picture. Both are for the user's eyes — read data with the other tools.
- `task_tree_server open` pops the UI on the user's desktop; use it when the host cannot render widgets.
- If a tool call fails, fall back to the file rules below and say so.

**Compact current-state rule**

`task-tree.md` is the current working graph, not an append-only history log. History lives in `versions/`.

- Replace or delete stale content instead of adding tombstones like "deleted on ...".
- Before adding text, refine the touched node/edge: remove duplicated, superseded, or process-only notes.
- Keep hard budgets: one `Problem`; current-only `Approach` <=4 bullets; `CurrentResult` <=3 facts / 500 chars; `RootCauseAnalysis` <=2 sentences / 350 chars; at most 2 cases; one executable `NextIdea`.
- For big-tree cleanup, measure before/after bytes, lines, over-budget fields, and long lines (>240 chars). Touch the current path plus the top 8-15 over-budget nodes; target >=25% reduction in touched-node text and >=30% fewer long lines, unless preserved facts block that.
- Parent nodes are indexes, not storage bins: if a node has child/formula nodes, keep only the current conclusion, 2-3 key numbers, and child/file references.
- If old text conflicts with the current method, rewrite/delete the old text; do not keep both old and new methods live.
- `Input`/`Output` should use 1-5 representative inline sample lines plus optional real file paths; bulky evidence belongs in files that the UI can preview.
- Add a new node only for a genuinely separate subproblem with distinct input/output/metrics.
- If a method/order change affects execution order, also update `scripts/project.json` or `scripts/run.json`; CurrentResult-only edits usually do not.
- Tree saves/postflight automatically synchronize deterministic flow statuses and create minimal step evidence; Agents must still resolve missing/stale blocks and intentional order changes.
- Do not over-refine: preserve current measured facts, unresolved risks, user decisions, and active constraints.

**Every task — read-only tree context (default)**

1. If you need execution focus, read `task-tree.md` and use `GraphState.Current`, `GraphState.Next`, and the **Next node's `NextIdea`**. `NextPlan` is a possibly stale user memo and MUST NOT be executed.
   This advisory-only policy overrides older executable-NextPlan wording retained in the frozen full protocol for audit compatibility.
2. Treat the tree as authoritative; chat history and orphan files are evidence only.
3. **Do not** Read `llm-task-tree/AGENTS.task-tree.md`, tree skills, or `scripts/README.md` unless this turn will **edit** the tree or **edit execution flow** (below).

**When you WILL edit the task tree** (write/create/repair `task-tree.md`, `subtrees/*.md`, nodes, edges, or GraphState)

Before any write, **must Read in order** (same turn, before editing):

1. `llm-task-tree/AGENTS.task-tree.md`
2. `llm-task-tree/skills/task-tree-grill/SKILL.md`
3. `llm-task-tree/skills/task-tree-grill/references/schema-template.md`

Then backup `task-tree.md` to `versions/<timestamp>_<原因>.md` before manual edits (see protocol §7). Follow **all nodes → `# GraphState` → `# Edges`** order.

Cursor: `.cursor/rules/llm-task-tree-edit.mdc`

**When you WILL edit execution flow** (write `scripts/project.json`, `scripts/run.json`, or `PUT /api/flow-script`)

Before any write, **must Read in order** (same turn, before editing):

1. **`scripts/README.md`** — schema、块类型、何时改/不改、保存与备份（**执行流程的权威写法**）
2. Current **`scripts/project.json`** (and **`scripts/run.json`** if editing run mode)
3. Skim **`task-tree.md`** (+ relevant `subtrees/*.md`) for valid **`nodeId`** values

Then backup to `scripts/versions/project/` or `scripts/versions/run/` (or use API with default backup). **Execution order lives in scripts, not in node ID sort or graph layout.**

Cursor: `.cursor/rules/llm-task-tree-flow-edit.mdc` · Full gate: `llm-task-tree/AGENTS.task-tree.md` §1c

**End of task — only if you edited the tree or flow this turn**

1. Update the smallest relevant node(s) and/or `blocks`; tell the user what changed.
2. For node `Input`/`Output`, paste **inline real content** with `# comment` per line — not bare paths.
3. If flow changed, note it in the affected node's `Notes`.
4. If any tree/subtree changed, run `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File llm-task-tree/check-tree-compact.ps1 <changed tree paths>`. Non-zero exit blocks completion: semantically rewrite every reported over-budget field and rerun until it passes. Never mechanically truncate facts. Codex Stop hooks enforce this automatically; other Agents must run it explicitly.

**No tree yet**

Create from `llm-task-tree/templates/task-tree.starter.md`, or run **task-tree-grill** (Read tree paths above first).

**UI**: `llm-task-tree/打开任务图.cmd` → **关系图 | 执行流程** for `scripts/project.json` / `scripts/run.json`.
